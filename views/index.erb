        This page is a front end to my solutions to the lovely challenges you wrote. It combines jQuery and the Sinatra Ruby gem to give you an interactive version to my solutions.

        <h3>Marklar the string</h3>
        <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Assume that "str" is a sequence of words separated by spaces. Return a string in which every word in "str" that exceeds 4 characters is replaced with "marklar". If the word being replaced has a capital first letter, it should instead be replaced with "Marklar".</p>
        <form class='form-inline'>
          <input class='form-control' value="Down goes Frasier." id="marklar-input"></input>
          <button class='btn btn-primary' id="marklar-button">marklar</button>
        </form>

        <p class="output"><strong>Output:</strong> <span id="marklar-output"></span></p>

      <div class='col-md-6 box'>
        <h3>Even Fib Sum</h3>
        <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Return the sum of all even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, up to the "nth" term in the sequence eg. the Fibonacci sequence up to 6 terms is (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), and the sum of its even numbers is (2 + 8) = 10</p>
        <form class='form-inline'>
          <input class='form-control' type="number" min=0 value=0 id="fib-input"></input>
          <button class='btn btn-primary' id="fib-button">fibonacci!</button>

      A little about me:
    </h2>
    <p>
      I currently develop in Rails at a manufacturing company in Santa Fe Springs. My current responsibilities are building a system that uses web-enabled odometers to track machine up time and material usage. I am the only developer on the team, which means I've learned to iterate quickly based on multiple team members' inputs, know my limits and research to fulfill the team's needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am design minded and a dogged problem solver. If you'd like to talk you can email me at rvanstong@gmail.com, see my <a href="/img/Ryan Stong Simplest CV.pdf">resum√©</a>, or look at my personal <a href="http://dezdoes.tech">website</a>. I look forward to hearing from you!
