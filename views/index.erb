  This page is a front end to my solutions to the lovely challenge you wrote. It combines jQuery and the Sinatra Ruby gem to give you an interactive version to my solutions.

<h3>Marklar the string!</h3>
<p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Assume that "str" is a sequence of words separated by spaces. Return a string in which every word in "str" that exceeds 4 characters is replaced with "marklar". If the word being replaced has a capital first letter, it should instead be replaced with "Marklar".</p>
<form>
<input value="There goes Frasier." id="marklar-input"></input>
<button id="marklar-button">marklar</button>
</form>
<p>Output:<span id="marklar-output"></span></p>
